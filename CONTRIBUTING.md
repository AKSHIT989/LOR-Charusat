# LOR-Charusat
Automating the process of Letter of Recommendation for CHARUSAT

### Process for contributing for collaborators:

1. For each feature or enhancement make a branch with proper naming conventions refer https://dev.to/couchcamote/git-branching-name-convention-cch

You can checkout to a different branch using this command: 
```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

2. After completing your changes push the changes back to remote
```
git add .
git commit -m "proper-message"
git push origin <branch-name>
```
3. If all things are good make a pull request but ```DON'T``` merge it directly.

4. If you are working on a new task then synchronise your local copy with remote repo and then start building
```
git pull origin main
```
5. Document your code well and follow good naming conventions for variables and functions :)
